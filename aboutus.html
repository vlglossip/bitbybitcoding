            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Bit by Bit Coding was founded with a simple but powerful goal: to make programming education accessible to all. Our journey began when our founder, an NCWIT Impact Award-winning advocate for computer science, saw firsthand the barriers that prevent students—especially young girls and international learners—from accessing quality coding education.

                Starting as a personal mission to bridge this gap, Bit by Bit Coding has grown into a global initiative. From authoring A Girl’s Blueprint to Building Websites to launching a YouTube channel and middle school clubs, our founder has worked tirelessly to empower the next generation of programmers.
                
                Through our efforts, we’ve reached over 4,500 individuals, offering free coding lessons and hands-on expereinces..
                
                Bit by Bit Coding continues to grow, expanding into new initiatives like "Bit by Bit in a Kit," which equips students with the resources to start their own coding clubs. With every lesson taught and every student empowered, we are proving that anyone, anywhere, can learn to code—bit by bit.
