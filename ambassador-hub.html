        <h1>Become an Ambassador</h1>

        <h3>Lead with Purpose. Build with Vision.</h3>
        <p>As a Bit by Bit Ambassador, you’ll launch and lead a Bit by Bit chapter at your school or in your community, guiding peers through our yearlong coding curriculum.</p>

        <p>We’ll equip you with the curriculum, tools, and support you need. Your chapter will have the opportunity to compete as a team in our global hackathons, turning ideas into real-world impact. Every few months, you’ll submit a brief check-in.</p>

        <p>Our curriculum is designed to introduce coding to learners of all ages: from curious upper elementary school students to motivated teens and adults looking to dive into tech.</p>

        <h3>You’re not just joining a program, you’re starting a movement.</h3>
